## Blockers & Decisions

### Open Questions
- [ ] Which NATS deployment model? (Embedded vs separate container)
- [ ] JWT signing strategy? (Symmetric vs asymmetric keys)
- [ ] Embedding model for evidence_snippets? (OpenAI vs local)
- [ ] CSV upload size limits?

### Decisions Made
- ✅ Use Drizzle ORM for type safety
- ✅ Use Zod for runtime validation
- ✅ Use Fastify for performance
- ✅ NATS for event bus (not Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- ✅ Separate packages for contracts/schema/utils (enforces boundaries)

## Integration with Workers 1 & 2

### Worker 1 (IaC/Security/Observability)
**Coordination Points**:
- ✅ OTel traces for web-vitals correlation
- ✅ Staging deployment (domain, SSL, env vars)
- ✅ SSO integration (if OIDC provider available)
- ✅ Security review for gen-AI endpoints
- ✅ Secrets management for AI API keys

**Communication**: Tag Worker 1 lead on PRs for staging rollout, OTel setup, secrets

### Worker 2 (Backend Services)
**Coordination Points**:
- ✅ Reporting service extensions (evidence, gen-reports APIs)
- ✅ Q2Q evidence query optimization
- ✅ Impact-In delivery status (coordinate with integration services)
- ✅ Tenant-scoped database queries

**Communication**: Tag Worker 2 lead on PRs for reporting/q2q changes, API contracts

---

## Documentation Deliverables

**Phase C Docs** (all in `/docs/` or `/reports/`):
- [ ] `/docs/pilot/staging_rollout.md` - Deployment playbook
- [ ] `/docs/cockpit/gen_reporting.md` - AI reporting guide
- [ ] `/docs/cockpit/branding.md` - Theming constraints
- [ ] `/reports/worker3_phaseC_pilot.md` - Final report with screenshots
- [ ] `/reports/a11y_audit_phaseC.md` - Accessibility audit
- [ ] OpenAPI updates in `/docs/api/index.md` for new endpoints

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Evidence lineage is mandatory** for all AI-generated narratives
2. **No secrets in frontend** - all AI calls server-side
3. **Privacy-first**: No raw PII in UI; redaction on server; safe rendering
4. **Performance budgets**: LCP ≤ 2.0s, INP ≤ 200ms
5. **WCAG 2.2 AA compliance**: Enforced by CI
6. **Kintell remains the matcher** - cockpit reads Reporting APIs only
7. **Feature flags** for all pilot features (toggle off if issues)
8. **Tenant isolation**: RBAC + database query scoping enforced

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Staging cockpit runs with real tenant + RBAC; demo creds disabled
- ✅ Evidence Explorer shows lineage with anonymized previews
- ✅ "Why this metric?" works on all widgets
- ✅ Gen-AI report generates with **citations**; PDF export renders correctly
- ✅ Scheduled emails fire in staging
- ✅ Web-vitals collected to OTel; budgets pass
- ✅ A11y CI job green
- ✅ Impact-In Monitor displays delivery history + supports replay
- ✅ Theming works per tenant
- ✅ All new endpoints documented with OpenAPI
- ✅ Performance report and a11y audit in `/reports/`

---
