## Blockers & Decisions

### Open Questions
- [ ] Which NATS deployment model? (Embedded vs separate container)
- [ ] JWT signing strategy? (Symmetric vs asymmetric keys)
- [ ] Embedding model for evidence_snippets? (OpenAI vs local)
- [ ] CSV upload size limits?

### Decisions Made
- ✅ Use Drizzle ORM for type safety
- ✅ Use Zod for runtime validation
- ✅ Use Fastify for performance
- ✅ NATS for event bus (not Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- ✅ Separate packages for contracts/schema/utils (enforces boundaries)

## Documentation Deliverables

**Phase C Docs** (all in `/docs/` or `/reports/`):
- [ ] `/docs/pilot/staging_rollout.md` - Deployment playbook
- [ ] `/docs/cockpit/gen_reporting.md` - AI reporting guide
- [ ] `/docs/cockpit/branding.md` - Theming constraints
- [ ] `/reports/worker3_phaseC_pilot.md` - Final report with screenshots
- [ ] `/reports/a11y_audit_phaseC.md` - Accessibility audit
- [ ] OpenAPI updates in `/docs/api/index.md` for new endpoints

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Evidence lineage is mandatory** for all AI-generated narratives
2. **No secrets in frontend** - all AI calls server-side
3. **Privacy-first**: No raw PII in UI; redaction on server; safe rendering
4. **Performance budgets**: LCP ≤ 2.0s, INP ≤ 200ms
5. **WCAG 2.2 AA compliance**: Enforced by CI
6. **Kintell remains the matcher** - cockpit reads Reporting APIs only
7. **Feature flags** for all pilot features (toggle off if issues)
8. **Tenant isolation**: RBAC + database query scoping enforced

---

# Worker 2 Phase D: Backend Criticals Design Note

**Status**: 🚧 In Progress
**Branch**: `claude/backend-criticals-rbac-gdpr-analytics-013DvoKrwXyKfmLi9xgW6sCr`
**Started**: 2025-11-14
**Priority**: P0/P1 Backend Foundation
**Target Completion**: TBD

---

## Mission

Close critical backend gaps identified in Worker 2 core services:
1. **RBAC & Tenant Security (P0)**: Database-backed tenant membership validation with audit trails
2. **Impact-In Connectors (P1)**: Production-grade HTTP/OAuth/SOAP clients for external integrations
3. **GDPR DSAR Orchestrator (P1)**: Privacy-compliant data export/deletion workflows
4. **Analytics Backfill (P1)**: Historical data migration Postgres → ClickHouse
5. **Performance Caching (P2)**: Redis caching for frequently-called endpoints

---

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists ✅
- ✅ `api-gateway/middleware/tenantScope.ts` - Extracts tenant from JWT/headers, but **validates via JWT only** (line 87-91 TODO)
- ✅ `api-gateway/middleware/rbac.ts` - Roles & permissions defined, but no DB queries
- ✅ `impact-in/connectors/benevity/client.ts` - Basic retry/backoff, missing idempotency & webhook signatures
- ✅ `impact-in/connectors/goodera/` & `workday/` - Mappers exist, clients are stubs
- ✅ `analytics/sinks/loader.ts` - Incremental NATS ingestion works, **backfill stubbed** (line 83-91 TODO)
- ✅ `shared-schema/migrations/0004_add_idempotency_tables.sql` - Event deduplication tables exist

### What's Missing ❌
- ❌ **Migrations**: `company_users`, `company_api_keys`, `audit_logs`, `consent_records`, `dsar_requests`
- ❌ **Seed data**: No `/packages/shared-schema/seeds/` directory
- ❌ **RBAC DB queries**: tenantScope.ts doesn't validate `company_users` membership
- ❌ **Redis caching**: No caching middleware for RBAC lookups, SROI/VIS, Q2Q
- ❌ **Impact-In production features**: Idempotency keys, webhook signature verification, OAuth refresh, WS-Security
- ❌ **Privacy orchestrator**: No `services/privacy-orchestrator/` service
- ❌ **Analytics backfill**: Postgres → ClickHouse historical data loader unimplemented
- ❌ **Documentation**: No runbooks for Impact-In, GDPR, Analytics

---

## Architecture: Tables → Middleware → Services

### 1. RBAC & Tenant Security Flow

#### Database Tables (New Migrations)

**Migration File**: `/packages/shared-schema/migrations/0013_add_rbac_and_privacy_tables.sql`

Tables to create:
- `company_users` - Tenant membership registry
- `company_api_keys` - Programmatic access tokens
- `audit_logs` - Tamper-proof audit trail
- `consent_records` - GDPR consent tracking
- `dsar_requests` - Data Subject Access Requests

#### Middleware Enhancements

**File**: `/services/api-gateway/src/middleware/tenantScope.ts` (line 76-92 replacement)
- Replace JWT-only validation with DB query to `company_users`
- Add Redis caching (TTL: 5 minutes) for membership lookups
- Audit all failed access attempts to `audit_logs` table
- Update `last_access_at` asynchronously

**New File**: `/services/api-gateway/src/middleware/auditLog.ts`
- Helper function to insert audit events
- Emit audit events to NATS for real-time monitoring

**Cache Invalidation Strategy**:
- On role change: Invalidate `tenant:${userId}:*` keys
- On user deactivation: Invalidate all keys for user
- Pub/Sub pattern to notify all gateway instances

---

### 2. Impact-In Connectors Production Features

#### Benevity Enhancements
**File**: `/services/impact-in/src/connectors/benevity/client.ts`

Add:
- Idempotency key support in headers
- Response caching for 24 hours on success
- Webhook signature verification using HMAC-SHA256
- Timing-safe signature comparison

#### Goodera OAuth2 Flow
**New File**: `/services/impact-in/src/connectors/goodera/oauth.ts`

Features:
- Token caching in Redis with TTL
- Automatic token refresh before expiry
- Retry logic for token endpoint failures

#### Workday WS-Security
**New File**: `/services/impact-in/src/connectors/workday/soap.ts`

Features:
- SOAP client with WS-Security headers
- Multi-tenant endpoint discovery
- Connection pooling for performance

---

### 3. GDPR DSAR Orchestrator

**New Service**: `/services/privacy-orchestrator/`

Architecture:
```
API Gateway /privacy routes
  ↓
Privacy Orchestrator
  ↓ (fan-out via NATS)
  ├─→ Unified Profile Service (user data)
  ├─→ Kintell Connector (session data)
  ├─→ Buddy Service (match/event data)
  ├─→ Reporting Service (analytics snapshots)
  └─→ Q2Q AI Service (outcome scores, evidence)
```

**Key Files**:
- `/services/privacy-orchestrator/src/handlers/export.ts` - Data export with encryption
- `/services/privacy-orchestrator/src/handlers/delete.ts` - 30-day deletion with cancellation
- `/services/privacy-orchestrator/src/index.ts` - Fastify service setup

**Export Flow**:
1. Create DSAR request in DB with status "pending"
2. Fan-out export requests to all services via NATS
3. Aggregate responses into JSON structure
4. Encrypt with job-specific key
5. Upload to S3 with 30-day expiry
6. Update DB with export URL
7. Send notification email

**Delete Flow**:
1. Create DSAR request with 30-day cancellation window
2. Schedule deletion event in NATS JetStream
3. User can cancel within 30 days
4. After 30 days, fan-out delete to all services
5. Mark as completed and audit log

---

### 4. Analytics Backfill Loader

**File**: `/services/analytics/src/sinks/loader.ts` (line 79-94 implementation)

**Backfill Strategy**:
1. Query `metrics_company_period` table in batches (10K rows)
2. Transform to ClickHouse schema
3. Check for duplicates before inserting
4. Batch insert to `metrics_timeseries` table
5. Save checkpoint after each batch
6. Resume from checkpoint on failure

**Deduplication**:
- Query ClickHouse for existing rows by composite key
- Filter out duplicates before insertion
- Prevents double-counting metrics

**Performance**:
- Streaming inserts (no full table load in memory)
- Parallel batch processing where safe
- Progress logging every 10K rows

---

### 5. Redis Caching for SROI/VIS and Q2Q

**New Utility**: `/packages/shared-utils/src/cache.ts`

**Caching Middleware**:
```typescript
cacheMiddleware({ 
  ttl: 3600,  // 1 hour
  key: (req) => `sroi:${req.params.companyId}:${req.query.period}`
})
```

**Apply To**:
- `/services/impact-calculator/src/routes/sroi.ts` - SROI calculations
- `/services/impact-calculator/src/routes/vis.ts` - VIS scores
- `/services/q2q-ai/src/routes/evidence.ts` - Q2Q evidence queries

**Invalidation Strategy**:
- On new event ingestion: Invalidate `sroi:${companyId}:*` and `vis:${companyId}:*`
- On Q2Q evidence update: Invalidate `q2q:evidence:${companyId}:*`
- Use Redis Pub/Sub to notify all service instances

---
