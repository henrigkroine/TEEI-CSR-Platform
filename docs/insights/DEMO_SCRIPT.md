## Act 1: Introduction & Simple Query (90 seconds)

### Talking Points

> "Welcome to the TEEI CSR Platform's Natural Language Query capability. Instead of writing SQL or clicking through complex dashboards, you can simply ask questions in plain English about your CSR program data."
>
> "Let me show you. I'm a Chief Impact Officer preparing for a quarterly board meeting, and I need to know our Social Return on Investment."

### Actions

**[0:00 - 0:15]** Navigate to Insights > NLQ page

**Screen Recording Point**: Capture the clean, minimal input interface

**[0:15 - 0:30]** Type in the query box:

### Talking Points

> "In under 2 seconds, the system understood my question, validated it against safety guardrails, queried the database, and returned a precise answer with 95% confidence."
>
> "Notice the system provides both a visual stat card AND a natural language summary. This means every $1 invested in our CSR programs returned $6.23 in social value last quarter."

**Key Highlight**: Speed + Confidence + Natural Language

---

## Act 2: Trend Analysis & Visualization (120 seconds)

### Talking Points

> "Now, a single quarter is good, but I want to understand the trend over time. Let me ask a follow-up question."

### Actions

**[1:30 - 1:45]** Type in the query box:

```
Show me SROI trend for the past year
```

**[1:45 - 2:00]** Click "Ask" button

**Screen Recording Point**: Show query processing (still under 2.5s)

**[2:00 - 2:30]** Result appears:

- **Line chart**: 12 monthly data points (Nov 2024 - Oct 2025)
- **Trend line**: Upward trajectory from 5.82 to 6.42
- **Data labels**: Hover over points to see exact values
- **Insight card**: "10.3% improvement year-over-year"

### Talking Points

> "Beautiful. The system recognized this as a trend analysis query and automatically generated a time-series visualization. I can see we've improved from 5.82 to 6.42 over the year—that's 10.3% growth."
>
> "Notice I can hover over any data point to see the exact value and date. The chart is interactive and built for exploration."

**[2:30 - 3:00]** Click "Show Lineage" button

**Screen Recording Point**: Lineage visualization panel slides in from right

- **Node 1**: `metrics_company_period` (source table, 12 records)
- **Node 2**: SROI aggregation calculation
- **Node 3**: Final result (high confidence)

### Talking Points

> "Here's where trust comes in. I can click 'Show Lineage' to see exactly where this data came from. It shows the source table, the calculation performed, and the confidence level at each step."
>
> "This is critical for compliance officers and auditors who need to verify data provenance for GDPR or SOC 2 requirements."

**Key Highlight**: Trend Analysis + Interactive Charts + Data Lineage

## Act 3: Evidence Lineage & Trust (90 seconds)

### Talking Points

> "Let's look at something more complex—outcome scores, which are generated by our Q2Q AI pipeline from participant feedback."

### Actions

**[3:00 - 3:15]** Type in the query box:

```
What are our outcome scores by dimension?
```

**[3:15 - 3:30]** Click "Ask" button

**Screen Recording Point**: Query processes in ~2 seconds

**[3:30 - 4:00]** Result appears:

- **Horizontal bar chart**: 5 dimensions (confidence, belonging, well-being, job_readiness, language)
- **Scores**: Ranging from 0.75 to 0.82
- **Sample sizes**: Displayed on hover (n=295 to n=342)
- **Confidence**: 89% (medium-high due to AI pipeline variance)

### Talking Points

> "Excellent. I can see confidence and belonging are our strongest outcome areas at 0.82, while language proficiency at 0.75 has room for growth."
>
> "The system automatically grouped by dimension and calculated averages. Sample sizes are robust—over 300 responses per dimension."

**[4:00 - 4:30]** Click "Show Lineage" button again

**Screen Recording Point**: More complex lineage graph

- **Node 1**: `outcome_scores` table (1,616 records)
- **Node 2**: JOIN with `users` table (tenant filter via EXISTS)
- **Node 3**: Dimension aggregation (AVG, COUNT, STDDEV)
- **Node 4**: Final result (5 dimensions, high confidence)

### Talking Points

> "The lineage here is more complex because this involves AI-generated scores. You can see the data flows from feedback text, through our Q2Q AI classification pipeline, into the outcome_scores table, filtered by tenant for security, then aggregated."
>
> "Every step is auditable. If compliance asks 'where did this number come from?', we have a complete trail."

**Key Highlight**: AI-Generated Outcomes + Complex Lineage + Security (Tenant Isolation)

## Act 4: Complex Query & Export (90 seconds)

### Talking Points

> "Let me show you one more advanced capability—asking about engagement trends over time."

### Actions

**[4:30 - 4:45]** Type in the query box:

```
Show participant engagement over time for last 6 months
```

**[4:45 - 5:00]** Click "Ask" button

**Screen Recording Point**: Slightly longer processing (still under 2.5s)

**[5:00 - 5:30]** Result appears:

- **Combo chart**: Bar chart (participants) + Line chart (sessions per participant)
- **Dual Y-axes**: Left axis for counts, right axis for ratio
- **Trend**: Both metrics increasing (participants +9.7%, engagement ratio +4.5%)

### Talking Points

> "This is a composite metric. The bars show participant counts growing from 1,523 to 1,671—that's 9.7% growth. The line shows sessions per participant improving from 2.69 to 2.81."
>
> "This tells me participants aren't just signing up—they're engaging more deeply with our programs. That's a leading indicator of impact."

**[5:30 - 6:00]** Click "Export" dropdown

**Screen Recording Point**: Export options menu

- Export as PNG (for presentations)
- Export as CSV (raw data)
- Export as PDF (report-ready)

Select "Export as PNG" → Downloads chart image

### Talking Points

## Alternative Endings (Optional)

### For Technical Audiences

> "Under the hood, this uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for intent classification, Drizzle ORM for safe query generation, and a 12-point safety validation pipeline. Every query is logged for audit trails, and we enforce tenant isolation at the database level."

### For Compliance Audiences

> "Every query passes through 12 security checks before execution: SQL injection prevention, table whitelisting, PII column blacklisting, tenant isolation, row limits, and more. We maintain complete audit logs for GDPR Article 30 compliance."

### For Business Stakeholders

> "This capability reduces executive reporting time by 80%—what used to take a data analyst 2 hours now takes 2 seconds. And because it's self-service, business users can explore data without waiting on IT."

---

## Troubleshooting / Fallbacks

### If query takes too long (> 3 seconds):

> "Notice the query is taking a bit longer—this is because it's the first time we're accessing this data. Subsequent queries will be cached and return instantly."

### If confidence is low (< 80%):

> "The system is being transparent about uncertainty here. When confidence is below 85%, it shows a warning and suggests rephrasing the question. This prevents false confidence in ambiguous results."

### If query fails safety check:

> "Interesting—the system rejected this query because it exceeded our maximum time window of 365 days. This is a safety guardrail to prevent performance issues. Let me rephrase to ask for the last year specifically."

## Post-Demo Follow-Up

### Immediate Actions

1. **Share recording link** (if recorded)
2. **Send demo data access** (credentials for stakeholders to try themselves)
3. **Provide documentation** (`DEMO_SCENARIOS.md`, API docs)

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Can it query external data sources?**
A: Not yet—currently limited to our PostgreSQL warehouse. External data connectors (ClickHouse, BigQuery) are on the roadmap for Phase G3.

**Q: What happens if it misunderstands my question?**
A: The system shows low confidence (< 80%) and suggests rephrasing. You can also click "Show Intent" to see how it interpreted your question and correct it.

**Q: How much does this cost per query?**
A: Claude API calls cost ~$0.003 per query. We cache results aggressively, so repeat queries are free. Typical cost is under $50/month for a 500-employee company.

**Q: Can I restrict which users can ask certain questions?**
A: Yes—we enforce RBAC at the template level. Certain metrics (e.g., financial SROI) can be restricted to executive roles only.

**Q: Is this SOC 2 compliant?**
A: Yes—we maintain complete audit logs, enforce least-privilege access, encrypt queries in transit/at rest, and validate every query against security policies before execution.
