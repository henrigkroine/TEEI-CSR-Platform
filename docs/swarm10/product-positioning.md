---

## Executive Summary

The TEEI CSR Platform is the **first AI-powered CSR measurement platform** that transforms qualitative social impact into quantifiable business outcomes. Unlike legacy CSR tools that track volunteer hours and donations, TEEI delivers real-time **Social Return on Investment (SROI)**, **Volunteer Impact Scores (VIS)**, and evidence-based narratives that prove impact to executives, investors, and regulators.

**Tagline**: *"From Impact Stories to Business Outcomes – Powered by AI"*

---

## Core Value Proposition

### For CSR Directors & Sustainability Officers

**Problem**:
- CSR programs generate qualitative stories (feedback, testimonials) but lack quantifiable metrics
- Executives demand ROI, not anecdotes
- Manual reporting takes weeks; data is siloed across Benevity, Workday, Goodera
- CSRD/ESRS compliance requires evidence-based impact narratives

**Solution**:
TEEI's **Q2Q AI Engine** converts qualitative feedback into quantitative outcome scores (SROI, VIS), automates CSRD-aligned reports, and provides real-time executive dashboards with evidence lineage.

**Unique Value**:
- **AI-Powered Impact Measurement**: Q2Q AI converts "helped me find a job" → SROI 4.2
- **Evidence-Based Reporting**: Every metric links to source evidence (citations, provenance)
- **Unified Integration**: One platform for Benevity, Workday, Goodera (vs. fragmented tools)
- **Regulatory-Ready**: CSRD/ESRS compliance out-of-the-box (Gen-AI narratives)
