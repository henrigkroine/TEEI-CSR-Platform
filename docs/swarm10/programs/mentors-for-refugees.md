## Product Overview

**Mentors for Refugees** is a 1:1 mentor matching program that connects corporate employees with refugee job seekers to unlock career opportunities through guidance, networking, and skill development.

**Tagline**: *"From Refugee to Professional – One Mentor at a Time"*

---

## The Problem

Refugees face 3 critical barriers to employment:
1. **No Local Network**: 78% of refugees have no professional contacts in their host country (UNHCR, 2024)
2. **Skills Gap**: 65% have qualifications not recognized locally (require upskilling/re-certification)
3. **Cultural Barriers**: Language, workplace norms, interview skills unfamiliar

**Result**: 42% unemployment rate for refugees vs. 5% national average (Eurostat, 2024)

---

## The Solution

**Mentors for Refugees** pairs corporate volunteers with refugee mentees for:
- **Career Guidance**: Resume reviews, interview prep, job search strategies
- **Networking**: Introductions to hiring managers, industry events
- **Skill Development**: Technical skills, soft skills, certifications
- **Cultural Integration**: Workplace norms, communication styles

**Outcome**: 68% employment rate for mentees within 6 months (vs. 42% baseline)

---

## How It Works

### 1. Matching (AI-Powered)
- **Mentee Profile**: Skills, experience, job goals (e.g., "Software Engineer seeking DevOps role")
- **Mentor Profile**: Industry, skills, availability (e.g., "Senior DevOps Engineer, 2 hrs/month")
- **AI Compatibility Scoring**: Q2Q AI matches based on skills overlap, industry fit, location

**Example Match**:
```
Mentee: Fatima (Syrian refugee, QA Engineer, seeking Software Test Engineer role)
Mentor: Sarah (Senior Test Engineer at TechFlow, 10 years experience)
Compatibility Score: 92% (skills: QA/automation, industry: SaaS, location: SF Bay Area)
```

### 2. Session Tracking
- **Goals**: Mentee sets 3-month goals (e.g., "Pass AWS cert," "Get 5 interviews")
- **Sessions**: Bi-weekly 1-hour video calls (tracked in platform)
- **Progress**: Milestone tracking (resume updated, cert achieved, interview scheduled)

**Platform Features**:
- Session scheduling (calendar integration)
- Goal tracking dashboard
- Resource library (resume templates, interview guides)
- Feedback collection (after each session)

### 3. Impact Measurement
- **Outcome Metrics**:
  - Employment Rate: 68% employed within 6 months
  - Salary Lift: $12K avg increase vs. previous role
  - Retention: 85% still employed after 1 year
  - SROI: $4.20 per $1 invested (Q2Q AI calculation)

- **Evidence Collection**:
  - Mentee feedback: "My mentor helped me land a job at Microsoft"
  - Mentor feedback: "Fatima is thriving – proud to have helped"
  - Employment verification: HR confirms hire date, salary range

- **SROI Calculation** (Q2Q AI):
```
Input: Mentee feedback + employment outcomes
Q2Q AI Analysis: "helped me land a job" → Employment outcome = True
Economic Value: $12K salary lift × 85% retention × 3 years = $30,600
Program Cost: $7,200 (mentor time + platform)
SROI: $30,600 / $7,200 = 4.25
```
