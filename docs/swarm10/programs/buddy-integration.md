## Product Overview

**Buddy Integration** is a workplace integration program that pairs newly hired refugees/migrants with employee "buddies" for social support, cultural onboarding, and belonging.

**Tagline**: *"From Newcomer to Team Member – Supported Every Step"*

---

## The Problem

**65% of refugee hires leave within first year** due to:
- Social isolation (no colleagues outside work)
- Cultural confusion (workplace norms unfamiliar)
- Lack of support (no one to ask "dumb questions")

**Result**: $15K cost per turnover (recruiting, training, lost productivity)

---

## The Solution

**Buddy Integration** pairs new hires with employee buddies for:
- **Social Support**: Coffee chats, lunch invites, cultural events
- **Cultural Onboarding**: Explain workplace norms, dress code, communication styles
- **Practical Help**: Navigate healthcare, banking, housing
- **Belonging**: "You're not alone – we're glad you're here"

**Outcome**: 85% retention after 1 year (vs. 35% without buddy program)

## How It Works

### 1. Buddy Matching
- **New Hire Profile**: Background, interests, language
- **Buddy Profile**: Department, interests, availability
- **Matching**: Auto-match by department, shared interests, language

**Example**:
```
New Hire: Omar (Syrian refugee, warehouse associate, speaks Arabic)
Buddy: Carlos (warehouse supervisor, 5 years tenure, speaks Arabic)
Match: Same department + language + seniority
```

### 2. Integration Activities
- **Week 1**: Welcome coffee chat (30 min)
- **Week 2-4**: Weekly check-ins (15 min)
- **Month 2-6**: Bi-weekly social activities (lunch, cultural events)
- **Month 6+**: Ongoing friendship (optional)

**Platform Features**:
- Activity tracking (coffee chats, events attended)
- Feedback collection (integration score, belonging)
- Resource library (cultural guides, local services)

### 3. Impact Measurement
- **Retention**: 85% after 1 year (vs. 35% baseline)
- **Integration Score**: 75% "feel part of team" (survey)
- **Cost Savings**: $15K/hire saved (turnover avoided)
- **SROI**: 3.2 (economic value of retention)

**SROI Calculation**:
```
Cost Savings: $15K turnover cost × 50% retention gain = $7,500
Program Cost: $2,350 (buddy time 20 hrs × $80/hr + platform $150)
SROI: $7,500 / $2,350 = 3.19
```
