## Persona 1: Sarah Chen – CSR Director

### Demographics
- **Age**: 38
- **Gender**: Female
- **Location**: San Francisco, CA
- **Education**: MBA (Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley)
- **Years in Role**: 5 years as CSR Director, 10 years in sustainability
- **Company**: TechFlow Inc. (Mid-market SaaS company, 1,500 employees, $200M revenue)

### Professional Background
**Career Path**: Sustainability Analyst → CSR Manager → CSR Director
**Reporting To**: Chief People Officer (CPO)
**Team Size**: 3 direct reports (2 CSR coordinators, 1 data analyst)
**Budget**: $1.2M/year CSR budget (0.6% of revenue)

### Goals & Objectives
**Primary Goals**:
1. Prove CSR ROI to CFO and Board (SROI >3.0)
2. Automate quarterly reporting (reduce from 2 weeks to <1 week)
3. Achieve CSRD compliance for EU expansion (target: 2026)
4. Scale refugee mentorship program (50 → 200 mentees/year)

**Success Metrics**:
- SROI: $3.50 per $1 invested (current: $2.80)
- Employee engagement: 75% participation in CSR programs (current: 60%)
- Time to report: <5 days for quarterly reports (current: 10–14 days)
- Compliance: CSRD-ready by Q4 2025

### Pain Points & Challenges
**Top Pain Points**:
1. **Manual Reporting**: "I spend 40% of my time creating reports manually in Excel. Our Q3 report took 80 hours."
2. **Lack of Data**: "We have anecdotal stories but no quantitative SROI. CFO doesn't trust our numbers."
3. **Fragmented Tools**: "We use Benevity for donations, Workday for volunteering, Google Sheets for mentorship. Nothing talks to each other."
4. **CSRD Pressure**: "Our EU expansion requires CSRD compliance. We have no idea where to start."
5. **Budget Scrutiny**: "CFO wants to cut CSR budget 20%. I need proof of ROI to defend it."

**Frustrations**:
- "Benevity costs $32K/year but doesn't calculate SROI"
- "Board meetings are stressful – I show up with anecdotes, not metrics"
- "Mentorship program has great stories but no way to measure employment outcomes"

### Daily Workflow & Tools
**Typical Day**:
- 9:00 AM: Check Benevity dashboard (donations, volunteer hours)
- 10:00 AM: Review mentorship program feedback (Google Forms)
- 11:00 AM: 1:1 with CSR coordinator (program updates)
- 2:00 PM: Work on quarterly report (Excel, PowerPoint)
- 4:00 PM: Prepare for CFO meeting (ROI justification)

**Current Tools**:
- **Benevity**: Donations, volunteering ($32K/year)
- **Workday**: HR data, volunteer time tracking
- **Google Sheets**: Mentorship program tracking
- **PowerPoint**: Quarterly reports (manual)
- **Slack**: Team communication

### Decision-Making Process
**Buying Process**:
1. **Research** (1–2 weeks): Google search, LinkedIn, peer recommendations
2. **Demo** (2–3 vendors): Request demos from TEEI, Benevity alternatives
3. **Internal Champion** (CFO approval): Prepare business case (ROI, time savings)
4. **Pilot** (3 months): Test with mentorship program first
5. **Purchase Decision** (CFO/CPO sign-off): Need Board approval for >$20K/year

**Decision Criteria** (ranked):
1. **SROI Accuracy** (must-have): Automated SROI calculations with evidence
2. **Time Savings** (must-have): <5 days for quarterly reports
3. **CSRD Compliance** (nice-to-have): Ready for EU expansion
4. **Price** (must-have): <$25K/year (cheaper than Benevity)
5. **Integrations** (nice-to-have): Benevity, Workday, Google Workspace

**Objections**:
- "Is AI-calculated SROI credible? Will CFO trust it?"
- "Can we migrate from Benevity without disrupting programs?"
- "Will this take 6 months to set up like YourCause?"

### Why TEEI?
**Key Selling Points**:
✅ **Q2Q AI calculates SROI automatically** → Solve "lack of data" pain
✅ **Gen-AI reports save 10+ hours/month** → Solve "manual reporting" pain
✅ **One platform replaces Benevity + spreadsheets** → Solve "fragmented tools" pain
✅ **CSRD compliance out-of-the-box** → Solve "CSRD pressure" pain
✅ **$18K/year (Professional tier)** → 44% cheaper than Benevity

**Emotional Drivers**:
- **Relief**: "Finally, I can spend time on programs, not reports"
- **Confidence**: "I'll walk into Board meetings with real metrics"
- **Validation**: "CFO will see CSR is an investment, not a cost"

**Willingness to Pay**: $1,499/mo (Professional) = $17,988/year + $10K L2I-500 bundle = **$28K/year total**
