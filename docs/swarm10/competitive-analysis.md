## Win/Loss Analysis (Hypothetical)

### Scenarios Where TEEI Wins

| Customer Profile | Why TEEI Wins | Competitor Displaced |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Mid-market tech** (1,500 employees, SF-based) | CSRD compliance needed for EU expansion; CFO demands SROI proof | Benevity (too expensive, no CSRD) |
| **European multinational** (8,000 employees, London) | CSRD mandatory; wants evidence-based narratives | YourCause (no CSRD features) |
| **Retail chain** (3,000 employees, Dallas) | Refugee integration program; tight budget | Benevity (too expensive), Goodera (no US presence) |
| **Financial services** (5,000 employees, NYC) | AI-powered analytics for investor ESG reporting | Benevity (manual SROI), Salesforce.org (too complex) |

### Scenarios Where TEEI Loses

| Customer Profile | Why TEEI Loses | Competitor Wins |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Global enterprise** (50,000 employees, Fortune 100) | Needs 100+ integrations, massive scale | Benevity (market leader, proven at scale) |
| **Nonprofit foundation** (grantmaking only) | Not a corporate CSR use case | Submittable (grants-focused) |
| **Company with Salesforce CRM** (deep SF ecosystem) | Already invested in Salesforce.org | Salesforce.org (ecosystem lock-in) |
| **Early-stage startup** (<100 employees, no CSR program) | Too small, no CSR maturity | None (not ready for CSR platform) |

## Threat Analysis

### Threat 1: Benevity Launches AI Features
**Likelihood**: Medium (next 12–18 months)
**Impact**: High (erodes AI differentiation)
**Mitigation**:
- Move fast: Ship Q2Q AI, Gen-AI reports, NLQ in next 6 months
- Patent/IP: Document Q2Q methodology as trade secret
- Relationship lock-in: L2I bundles create switching costs (Founding-8 program)

### Threat 2: Price War (Benevity Cuts Prices)
**Likelihood**: Low (Benevity focused on enterprise, not price-sensitive)
**Impact**: Medium (pressure on Essentials tier)
**Mitigation**:
- Defend on AI, not price: Emphasize SROI accuracy, CSRD compliance
- Value-based pricing: Tie to time savings, reporting automation ROI
- L2I bundles: Create value beyond software (impact funding)

### Threat 3: Regulatory Changes (CSRD Standards Shift)
**Likelihood**: Medium (CSRD evolving, ESRS updates)
**Impact**: Medium (Gen-AI templates may need rework)
**Mitigation**:
- Modular templates: Easy to update CSRD alignment
- Quarterly reviews: Monitor EFRAG updates, adjust prompts
- Customer advisory board: Co-create templates with compliance officers

### Threat 4: Data Privacy Backlash (AI on Sensitive Data)
**Likelihood**: Low (GDPR-compliant, PII partitioned)
**Impact**: High (trust erosion if breach)
**Mitigation**:
- SOC 2 Type II: Certify by Year 1
- EU-first deployment: Data residency in Frankfurt
- Transparency: Publish AI methodology, evidence lineage

### Against Goodera
**Message**: "Global deployment with AI-powered SROI"

## Market Entry Strategy

### Phase 1: Niche Dominance (Months 1–6)
**Target**: Companies with refugee/migrant programs (Mentors, Language, Buddy)
**Positioning**: "Only platform built for refugee integration impact measurement"
**Competitors**: Goodera (displaced), in-house tracking (replaced)

### Phase 2: CSRD Compliance Wave (Months 7–12)
**Target**: EU-listed companies needing CSRD compliance
**Positioning**: "CSRD compliance in 2 weeks, not 6 months"
**Competitors**: YourCause (displaced), manual reporting (replaced)

### Phase 3: Enterprise Expansion (Year 2)
**Target**: Benevity/YourCause customers seeking AI + CSRD
**Positioning**: "Next-gen CSR platform – AI-first, regulatory-ready"
**Competitors**: Benevity (displaced at renewal)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Market is ripe for disruption**: Legacy players (Benevity, YourCause) lack AI, CSRD features
2. **AI is the differentiator**: No competitor has Q2Q-style qualitative → quantitative conversion
3. **CSRD is a wedge**: EU regulation creates urgency; TEEI is only CSRD-ready platform
4. **Price is secondary**: Compete on value (time savings, SROI accuracy), not price
5. **Focus on mid-market first**: 500–5,000 employee companies (underserved by Benevity)
