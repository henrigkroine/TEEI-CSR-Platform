# TEEI CSR Platform - Complete Overview

**Document Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference for understanding TEEI, its programs, and the CSR Platform. All development, design, and product decisions should align with this context.

## Part 1: About TEEI

### What is TEEI?

**TEEI = The Educational Equality Institute**

TEEI is an international nonprofit organization registered in:

- **Norway** (NGO headquarters)

- **United States** (501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity)

**Motto:** Equality Through Education

**Mission:** To expand educational equality for disadvantaged girls and women by providing accessible, high-quality learning, skills training, and mentorship — while also supporting wider communities affected by war and displacement.

**Vision:** A world where every girl and woman — regardless of conflict, displacement, or background — can access the education and economic opportunities needed to thrive.

### Who TEEI Serves

**Primary beneficiaries:**

- Ukrainians affected by war (inside Ukraine and displaced across Europe)

- Refugees and asylum seekers

- Displaced people rebuilding their lives

- Disadvantaged girls and women

- Underserved communities (expanding to US and Latin America)

**Scale achieved:**

- 20,000+ Ukrainians and family members reached

- 2,000+ mentees on Mentors for Ukraine

- 400+ active mentors

- 8,000+ learners on Language Connect

- 250+ remote job opportunities brokered

- 4,000+ children supported through partner recovery camps

**Strategic goal:** Education, upskilling, and mentoring for 100,000 Ukrainians under the "Together for Ukraine" framework.

### The Problem TEEI Solves

For Ukrainians and marginalized communities worldwide, the barriers are:

1. **Education and careers disrupted** by war, displacement, or chronic inequality

2. **Language barriers** in host countries and global digital work

3. **Lack of access** to market-relevant digital and business skills

4. **Limited networks** — no mentors, no insight into how hiring really works

5. **Under-representation** of women in entrepreneurship, tech, and leadership

TEEI's response is practical, scalable pathways:

```
Language → Education & Skills → Mentorship → Jobs & Entrepreneurship
```

## Part 3: The CSR Platform

### What is the CSR Platform?

The TEEI CSR Platform is an **enterprise-grade operating system** that allows corporations to run, track, and measure the impact of TEEI's programs with their employees as volunteers.

**It is NOT:**

- A grant application system

- A fundraising tool

- A donation platform

**It IS:**

- A volunteer program management system

- An impact measurement platform

- A corporate CSR reporting tool

- An operational backbone for TEEI

### Why This Platform Exists

**The problem with corporate volunteering today:**

- Data is scattered across spreadsheets

- Impact is impossible to measure ("We did good" but no proof)

- Volunteer engagement is shallow and unmeasured

- Refugee/participant progress is invisible

- Companies cannot prove ROI to executives

- Nonprofits cannot scale operations

- Reporting is manual and unreliable

**What this platform solves:**

- Single dashboard for all programs

- Real, quantifiable impact metrics (SROI, VIS)

- Automated matching and tracking

- Evidence-backed reporting

- AI-powered analysis of qualitative feedback

- Enterprise-ready compliance (GDPR, data protection)

## Part 4: Platform Features & Capabilities

### Core Metrics

#### SROI (Social Return on Investment)

**Formula:** `SROI = Total Social Value Created / Total Investment`

**What it measures:** For every $1 invested (including volunteer time), how much social value was created?

**Example output:** "SROI of 3.5:1" means $3.50 in social value for every $1 spent

**Components:**

- Dimension values: Integration ($150), Language ($500), Job Readiness ($300)

- Volunteer hour value: $29.95/hour (Independent Sector 2024)

- Confidence discount applied if data quality is low

#### VIS (Volunteer Impact Score)

**Formula:** `VIS = (hours × 0.3) + (quality × 0.3) + (outcome × 0.25) + (placement × 0.15)`

**What it measures:** How effective is each volunteer's contribution?

**Score bands:**

- Exceptional: ≥90

- High Impact: ≥75

- Good: ≥60

- Developing: ≥40

- Needs Improvement: <40

### Key Platform Components

#### 1. Corporate Cockpit Dashboard

The main interface for corporate users showing:

- KPI cards (participants, hours, SROI, VIS)

- Real-time metrics via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

- Campaign management

- Evidence explorer

- Report generation

#### 2. Q2Q AI Engine

**Purpose:** Convert qualitative feedback into quantitative scores

**How it works:**

- Takes feedback text (meeting notes, volunteer reflections, learner comments)

- Analyzes for: confidence changes, belonging, language proficiency, employability signals, risk cues

- Outputs measurable scores with citations back to source evidence

**Accuracy:** 0.87 macro F1 score (English), with multilingual support (EN/UK/NO)

#### 3. Journey Tracking

**Purpose:** Track participants across multiple programs

**Journey:** Buddy → Language Connect → Upskilling → Mentorship → Employment

**Flags computed:**

- `mentor_ready` — participant ready for mentorship

- `followup_needed` — participant needs intervention

- `language_support_needed` — participant needs language help

#### 4. Report Generation

**Purpose:** AI-powered generation of executive reports

**Features:**

- 4 templates: Quarterly, Annual, Investor Update, Impact Deep Dive

- PDF and PowerPoint export

- Every claim linked to source evidence (citations)

- PII automatically redacted

- CSRD/ESG compliance alignment

#### 5. Evidence Lineage

**Purpose:** Link every metric back to its source data

**Why it matters:** When an executive asks "Where does this number come from?", the platform can show the exact evidence trail.
