- **Total Social Value**: Estimated value of outcomes
- **SROI Ratio**: Social value ÷ Investment (e.g., 3.0:1 = $3 value per $1 invested)
- **Confidence Level**: 75-92% based on evidence quality
- **Outcome Categories**: Breakdown by impact type

### Sample Data

**Outcome Categories**:
- Employee retention and productivity
- Educational impact
- Community health benefits
- Skill development value
- Economic multipliers

### Evidence Requirements

Each SROI calculation links to:
- Program participation data
- Budget tracking
- Outcome measurements
- Q2Q evidence for validation
- Assumptions and discount rates

## VIS Scores

### Methodology

Volunteer Impact Scores (VIS) measure individual volunteer effectiveness:
- **Score Range**: 0-100
- **Factors**: Hours contributed, activities completed, quality ratings, consistency
- **Impact Multiplier**: Based on skill level (1.0-2.0)
- **Beneficiary Feedback**: Direct ratings from program participants

### Sample Data

**Range**: 78.5 to 95.5
**Average**: 88.4
**Top Performer**: GlobalCare volunteer (95.5)

**Skill Levels**:
- Beginner: 1.0x multiplier
- Intermediate: 1.25x multiplier
- Advanced: 1.45x multiplier
- Expert: 1.65-1.80x multiplier

### Consistency Scoring

- 80-90%: Regular participation, occasional absences
- 90-95%: Highly consistent, rarely misses sessions
- 95-100%: Exceptional reliability, never misses

## Q2Q Evidence

### Overview

Qualitative-to-Quantitative (Q2Q) evidence transforms feedback into measurable impact:
- **Total Items**: 20+ anonymized feedback snippets
- **Sentiment Distribution**: 80%+ positive, 10% mixed, 10% neutral
- **Confidence Scores**: 78-99%
- **Themes**: Extracted keywords and impact areas

### Evidence Types

1. **Feedback** (40%): Informal comments from participants
2. **Testimonials** (30%): Detailed personal stories
3. **Surveys** (20%): Structured questionnaire responses
4. **Observations** (10%): Program coordinator notes

### Sample Evidence

## Using Seed Data

### Exploration Activities

1. **Dashboard Review**: Examine KPI cards and trend visualizations
2. **Report Generation**: Create PDF/PPTX exports to see formatting
3. **Evidence Drill-Down**: Click on metrics to view supporting Q2Q evidence
4. **User Management**: Practice inviting/removing users (test environment only)
5. **Theme Testing**: Switch between presets to see branding changes

### Data Limitations

- **Not Production Data**: For demo/training purposes only
- **Static**: Data doesn't update in real-time
- **Limited History**: Only 6 months of data
- **No Real Beneficiaries**: All feedback is anonymized/fictionalized

### Best Practices

- Use seed data to learn features before adding real data
- Test export functionality with sample reports
- Practice access control with demo users
- Explore evidence lineage and confidence scoring
- Understand SROI/VIS calculations with realistic examples

## Refreshing Seed Data

If you need to reset the seed data:

1. Run cleanup SQL (see `/scripts/seed/pilot/README.md`)
2. Re-run seed scripts in order:
   - `companies.sql`
   - `users.sql`
   - `programs.sql`
   - `reports.sql`

> **Warning**: Only reset data in non-production environments!

## Next Steps

After exploring seed data:

1. **Plan Real Programs**: Map your actual CSR initiatives
2. **Define Metrics**: Decide what outcomes to measure
3. **Collect Evidence**: Set up Q2Q feedback collection
4. **Integrate Systems**: Connect HRIS, volunteering platforms
5. **Train Team**: Onboard colleagues using seed data examples
