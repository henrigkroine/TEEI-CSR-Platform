  Custom calibration for example-tenant based on 500 ground-truth labels.
  Increased job_readiness weight due to tenant focus on employment outcomes.
  Using GPT-4o for higher accuracy on complex feedback.

# Q2Q Model Configuration
q2q:
  model: gpt-4o  # Upgraded from gpt-4o-mini for better accuracy
  temperature: 0.2  # Lower temperature for more deterministic outputs
  maxTokens: 2500

  # Outcome dimension weights (must sum to 1.0)
  weights:
    confidence: 0.15
    belonging: 0.15
    language_proficiency: 0.2
    job_readiness: 0.35  # Emphasized for this tenant
    wellbeing: 0.15

  # Confidence thresholds per dimension
  thresholds:
    confidence: 0.75  # Slightly higher threshold
    belonging: 0.7
    language_proficiency: 0.8  # Higher threshold for language
    job_readiness: 0.75
    wellbeing: 0.7

# SROI Calculator Configuration
sroi:
  deadweightFactor: 0.08  # Lower deadweight based on tenant data
  attributionFactor: 0.9  # Higher attribution to program
  dropOffRate: 0.2  # Slower impact decline
  discountRate: 0.03

  # Custom financial proxies (USD)
  financialProxies:
    job_placement: 25000
    language_certification: 3000
    confidence_boost: 5000

# VIS Calculator Configuration
vis:
  weights:
    frequency: 0.3  # Emphasize frequency for this tenant
    duration: 0.25
    skills_applied: 0.25
    beneficiary_reach: 0.2

# Guardrails (cannot weaken global minimums)
guardrails:
  minFairnessThreshold: 0.92  # Stricter than global 0.9
  minPrivacyRedaction: true  # Cannot be disabled
  maxCostPerRequest: 0.3  # Lower budget than global 0.5

# Rollback Configuration
rollback:
  previousVersion: 0.9.0
  autoRollbackTriggers:
    - accuracy_drop
    - fairness_violation
