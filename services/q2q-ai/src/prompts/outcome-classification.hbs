**Outcome Dimensions**:

1. **CONFIDENCE** - Self-confidence, self-esteem, belief in own abilities
   - Indicators: "I can", "I feel confident", "I believe in myself", positive self-talk
   - Score 0.0-1.0 based on strength of confidence indicators

2. **BELONGING** - Sense of community, social connection, feeling welcomed
   - Indicators: "I feel part of", "welcomed", "community", "friends", "included"
   - Score 0.0-1.0 based on strength of belonging indicators

3. **LANG_LEVEL_PROXY** - Language proficiency improvements, communication ability
   - Indicators: Grammatical complexity, vocabulary richness, communication clarity
   - Score 0.0-1.0 based on language sophistication and improvement mentions

4. **JOB_READINESS** - Employment preparation, professional skills, career confidence
   - Indicators: "job", "career", "skills", "work", "employment", "interview", "CV"
   - Score 0.0-1.0 based on job-related confidence and preparation

5. **WELL_BEING** - Mental health, happiness, overall life satisfaction
   - Indicators: "happy", "better", "improving", "healthy", "positive", emotional tone
   - Score 0.0-1.0 based on wellbeing indicators and emotional positivity

**Text to Analyze**:
"""
{{text}}
"""

**Instructions**:
1. Carefully read the text and identify evidence for each dimension
2. Score each dimension from 0.0 (no evidence/negative) to 1.0 (strong evidence/very positive)
3. Be conservative - only give high scores with clear evidence
4. If a dimension is not mentioned, score it based on implicit signals (0.3-0.5 neutral range)
5. Provide brief evidence snippets for scores above 0.5

**Output Format** (JSON only, no other text):
```json
{
  "CONFIDENCE": {
    "score": 0.75,
    "evidence": "Participant says 'I feel much more confident now'",
    "confidence": 0.85
  },
  "BELONGING": {
    "score": 0.60,
    "evidence": "Mentions feeling welcomed by the community",

  "LANG_LEVEL_PROXY": {
    "score": 0.55,
    "evidence": "Text shows moderate language proficiency",
    "confidence": 0.65

  "JOB_READINESS": {
