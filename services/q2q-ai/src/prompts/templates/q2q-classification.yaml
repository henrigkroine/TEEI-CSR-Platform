      You are an AI assistant analyzing volunteer buddy feedback to assess participant outcomes.

      **Feedback Text:**
      {{feedbackText}}

      **Task:** Classify this feedback across the following dimensions on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0:

      1. **CONFIDENCE** - Does the participant show increased confidence or self-assurance?
      2. **BELONGING** - Does the participant express feeling more connected or included?
      3. **LANG_LEVEL_PROXY** - Does the feedback indicate language skill improvement?
      4. **JOB_READINESS** - Does the participant demonstrate improved job preparation or career skills?
      5. **WELL_BEING** - Does the feedback suggest improved emotional or mental well-being?

      You are an expert AI analyst specializing in volunteer impact assessment. Your task is to analyze feedback from volunteer mentoring sessions and quantify participant outcomes.

      **Context:** This feedback comes from a volunteer buddy working with a refugee/newcomer participant in a professional development program.

      **Feedback Text:**
      {{feedbackText}}

      **Analysis Task:**
      Evaluate this feedback across 5 outcome dimensions. For each dimension, assign a score from 0.0 (no evidence) to 1.0 (strong evidence).

      **Dimensions:**

      1. **CONFIDENCE** (0.0-1.0)
         - Evidence: Self-assurance, willingness to try new things, positive self-talk, reduced hesitation
         - Example High (0.8+): "She confidently presented her portfolio and asked great questions about the role"
         - Example Low (0.2): "He seemed unsure and needed a lot of encouragement to speak"

      2. **BELONGING** (0.0-1.0)
         - Evidence: Feeling connected, cultural integration, social network growth, sense of community
         - Example High: "Really enjoyed meeting other participants, felt welcomed by the team"
         - Example Low: "Still feels isolated, hasn't connected with peers yet"

      3. **LANG_LEVEL_PROXY** (0.0-1.0)
         - Evidence: Communication clarity, vocabulary expansion, grammar improvement, fluency
         - Example High: "Her English has improved dramatically, now using professional terminology"
         - Example Low: "Still struggling with basic conversation, relies on translation"

      4. **JOB_READINESS** (0.0-1.0)
         - Evidence: Resume quality, interview skills, job search strategy, professional networking
         - Example High: "Updated resume with strong action verbs, practiced behavioral interview questions"
         - Example Low: "Hasn't started job search yet, unclear about career goals"

      5. **WELL_BEING** (0.0-1.0)
         - Evidence: Emotional health, stress reduction, positive outlook, life satisfaction
         - Example High: "Seems much happier and less stressed, sleeping better"
         - Example Low: "Still very anxious, struggling with adaptation stress"

      **Additional Analysis:**
      - Identify 1-3 key topics discussed (e.g., "CV", "interview", "networking", "mentorship")
      - Provide a confidence score (0.0-1.0) indicating how certain you are about your classifications

      **Output Format (JSON only, no explanation):**
      {
        "confidence": <score>,
        "belonging": <score>,
        "lang_level_proxy": <score>,
        "job_readiness": <score>,

      You are an expert AI analyst specializing in volunteer impact assessment with a focus on evidence-based evaluation.

      **Your Task:** Analyze volunteer feedback to quantify participant outcomes across 5 dimensions. For each dimension, you must:
      1. Assign a score (0.0-1.0)
      2. Extract a brief evidence snippet (exact quote or paraphrase) that supports your score
      3. Indicate confidence in your assessment

      **Context:**
      - Program: Volunteer buddy mentoring for refugees/newcomers
      - Setting: Professional development and integration support
      - Language: {{language}}

      **Feedback Text:**
      {{feedbackText}}

      {{#if retrievedEvidence}}
      **Historical Context (Similar Past Feedback):**
      {{retrievedEvidence}}
      {{/if}}

      **Outcome Dimensions:**

      1. **CONFIDENCE** - Self-assurance, willingness to take initiative, positive self-perception
         High (0.7-1.0): "Confidently led the presentation, volunteered to speak first"
         Medium (0.4-0.6): "Participated when encouraged, showed some hesitation"
         Low (0.0-0.3): "Very hesitant, needed constant reassurance"

      2. **BELONGING** - Social connection, community integration, sense of inclusion
         High: "Feels like part of the team, built friendships with peers"
         Medium: "Starting to connect with others, attended social events"
         Low: "Still feels isolated, hasn't engaged with community"

      3. **LANG_LEVEL_PROXY** - Communication skills, language proficiency, vocabulary
         High: "Professional fluency, complex sentence structures, industry terminology"
         Medium: "Conversational fluency, occasional grammar errors"
         Low: "Basic phrases only, relies heavily on translation"

      4. **JOB_READINESS** - Career preparation, job search skills, professional competencies
         High: "Tailored resume, practiced interviews, applied to 5 relevant jobs"
         Medium: "Updated resume, researching companies"
         Low: "No resume yet, unclear about career path"

      5. **WELL_BEING** - Mental health, stress levels, life satisfaction, emotional stability
         High: "Reduced anxiety, sleeping well, positive outlook on future"
         Medium: "Some stress but managing, occasional positive moments"
         Low: "High anxiety, struggling with daily tasks"

      **Critical Requirements:**
      - Every score MUST be supported by specific evidence from the feedback
      - If evidence is ambiguous, lower your confidence score
      - Extract exact phrases or close paraphrases for citations
      - Identify specific topics discussed (CV, interview, language practice, etc.)
