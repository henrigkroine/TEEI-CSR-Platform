**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Total Length**: 1800-2200 words
- **Tone**: Inspiring, evidence-based, professional, persuasive (not academic)
- **Format**: Plain text with clear section headers (use "# Section Name")
- **Citations**: Inline [cite:ID] format, minimum 2 per paragraph, average 3-4 in outcome/story sections
- **No PII**: Evidence is already redacted; use "Participant A", "one refugee", "a program member" etc.
- **Narrative Arc**: Challenge → Intervention → Results → Value → Stories → Future
- **Visual Callouts**: Flag where charts should go (e.g., "[CHART: Outcome trends over time]", "[CHART: SROI breakdown]")

**CRITICAL RULES**:
✅ Every substantive paragraph must have at least 2 citations
✅ Use only evidence snippets provided above (do not fabricate participant voices)
✅ If a claim cannot be cited, soften it ("anecdotal feedback suggests...") or omit it
✅ Plain text only (no markdown bold/italic)
✅ Section headers with "# " prefix for parsing
✅ This is a marketing/stakeholder document - compelling but factual
✅ Charts: Suggest chart placements (we'll auto-pull VIS/SROI charts and outcome trends)

**CHART AUTO-PULL INSTRUCTIONS** (for downstream rendering):
The following charts will be automatically generated and inserted:
1. [CHART: Baseline vs. Current Outcomes] - 5-dimension radar chart comparing before/after
2. [CHART: SROI Value Breakdown] - Waterfall chart showing inputs → outputs → social value
3. [CHART: Outcome Trends Over Time] - Line chart showing 5 dimensions across program period
4. [CHART: Participant Journey Timeline] - Visual timeline of program phases and milestones
5. [CHART: VIS Score Components] - Breakdown of volunteer impact quality metrics

These will be inserted at logical points in the narrative (after relevant sections).
