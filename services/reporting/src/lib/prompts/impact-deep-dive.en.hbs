**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1. **Introduction: Study Design & Q2Q Methodology** (2 paragraphs, 250-300 words):
   - Explain the Q2Q approach: AI-powered extraction of outcome signals from participant feedback
   - Data sources: buddy check-ins, session feedback, mentor notes, self-assessments
   - AI classification: How each snippet is tagged with outcome dimension and confidence score
   - Validation: Human review, inter-rater reliability (if applicable)
   - Limitations: Self-reported data, potential selection bias, AI classification accuracy
   - CRITICAL: Transparent about methodology, cite 1-2 evidence snippets as examples

2. **Confidence & Self-Efficacy Deep Dive** (3 paragraphs, 400-450 words):
   - **Quantitative Finding**: {{formatPercent avgConfidence}} average score
   - **Qualitative Themes**: Analyze evidence snippets tagged as "confidence"
     * What are participants saying about their self-belief?
     * Common phrases: "I can do this now", "I feel capable", "I applied for a job"
     * Trajectory: Early-stage vs. late-stage confidence shifts
   - **Intersectional Analysis**: Do confidence scores vary by cohort, session type, volunteer pairing? (if evidence supports)
   - **Implications**: Why does confidence matter? Link to employment, social participation, mental health
   - CRITICAL: Minimum 3-4 citations per paragraph, weaving quantitative and qualitative

3. **Social Integration & Belonging Deep Dive** (3 paragraphs, 400-450 words):
   - **Quantitative Finding**: {{formatPercent avgBelonging}} average score
   - **Qualitative Themes**: Analyze "belonging" evidence
     * Indicators of social connection: "I made friends", "I feel part of the community", "people understand me"
     * Loneliness reduction, network expansion
     * Cultural bridging: participants connecting with local culture while maintaining heritage
   - **Mechanisms**: What program elements drive belonging? (mentorship, group activities, shared experiences)
   - **Implications**: Belonging as a precursor to long-term integration and well-being
   - CRITICAL: Minimum 3-4 citations, highlight participant voices

4. **Economic Empowerment (Job Readiness) Deep Dive** (3 paragraphs, 400-450 words):
   - **Quantitative Finding**: {{formatPercent avgJobReadiness}} average score
   - **Qualitative Themes**: Analyze "job readiness" evidence
     * CV preparation, interview skills, job applications, networking
     * Participant quotes: "I updated my CV", "I practiced interviews", "I got a callback"
     * Barriers overcome: credential recognition, language gaps, employer bias
   - **Pathways to Employment**: Connect job readiness scores to actual employment outcomes (if data available)
   - **Implications**: Economic empowerment as core to integration success and SROI value
   - CRITICAL: Minimum 3-4 citations, link to SROI denominator

5. **Language Acquisition Proxy Deep Dive** (3 paragraphs, 400-450 words):
   - **Quantitative Finding**: {{formatPercent avgLanguageLevel}} average proxy score
   - **Qualitative Themes**: Analyze "language" evidence
     * Self-assessed language progress: "I can speak better now", "I understand conversations", "I read the news in Norwegian"
     * Functional language use: navigating services, workplace communication, social interaction
     * Language as gateway: to employment, education, social connection
   - **Limitations**: This is a proxy (not CEFR-certified), based on AI-detected language signals in feedback
   - **Implications**: Language as both outcome and enabler of other outcomes
   - CRITICAL: Minimum 3-4 citations, acknowledge proxy nature

6. **Psychological Well-being Deep Dive** (3 paragraphs, 400-450 words):
   - **Quantitative Finding**: {{formatPercent avgWellBeing}} average score
   - **Qualitative Themes**: Analyze "well-being" evidence
     * Mental health indicators: reduced stress, hope for future, resilience
     * Participant quotes: "I feel less anxious", "I have hope", "I'm sleeping better"
     * Social determinants: how confidence, belonging, employment affect well-being
   - **Causal Pathways**: Does program participation improve well-being, or do higher-well-being participants engage more? (acknowledge ambiguity)
   - **Implications**: Well-being as both outcome and predictor of long-term integration success
   - CRITICAL: Minimum 3-4 citations, nuanced interpretation

7. **Cross-Cutting Themes & Interactions** (2 paragraphs, 250-300 words):
   - Analyze correlations: Do participants with high confidence also show high belonging? Job readiness?
   - Synergies: How do dimensions reinforce each other? (e.g., language → job readiness → well-being)
   - Outliers: Evidence of participants excelling in one dimension but struggling in another
   - Implications for program design: Should we target specific dimensions or take holistic approach?
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence showing multi-dimensional outcomes

8. **Volunteer Impact & VIS Analysis** (2 paragraphs, 250-300 words):
   - Explain VIS ({{formatNumber visScore 1}}/100) as a measure of volunteer effectiveness
   - Qualitative evidence of volunteer-participant relationships
     * Participant feedback on volunteers: "my mentor helped me", "I trust my buddy"
   - Volunteer quality vs. quantity: Is high VIS due to exceptional volunteers or structural factors?
   - Implications: How do we replicate high-VIS volunteer engagement at scale?
   - CRITICAL: Cite participant voices on volunteers

9. **Limitations & Future Research** (1-2 paragraphs, 200-250 words):
   - Methodological limitations: self-selection bias, AI classification errors, missing counterfactual
   - Data gaps: lack of long-term follow-up, employment verification, control group
   - Future research: longitudinal tracking, RCT design, external validation of AI classifications
   - Implications: Treat findings as directional, not causal proof
   - CRITICAL: Transparency on confidence levels in evidence

10. **Synthesis & Recommendations** (2 paragraphs, 250-300 words):
   - Summarize key findings across all five dimensions
   - Strongest outcomes: Which dimensions excel?
   - Areas for improvement: Which need more focus?
   - Recommendations for program enhancement, scaling, policy advocacy
   - CRITICAL: Ground recommendations in evidence, cite 2-3 key snippets
