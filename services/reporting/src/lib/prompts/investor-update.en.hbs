**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1. **Executive Summary** (1 paragraph, 120-150 words):
   - Lead with the SROI ratio: {{formatNumber sroiRatio 2}}:1
   - Translate to investor language: "This program generated €{{formatNumber (subtract sroiRatio 1) 2}} in social value for every €1 deployed"
   - Headline outcome: strongest performing dimension
   - Risk mitigation value: workforce diversity, community license to operate
   - CRITICAL: Cite 1-2 key evidence points

2. **SROI Methodology & Assumptions** (2 paragraphs, 250-300 words):
   - **Investment (Denominator)**:
     * Volunteer time valued at market rate (€X/hour × hours)
     * Program operational costs (facilitators, technology, space)
     * Overhead allocation
   - **Social Value Created (Numerator)**:
     * Employment outcomes valued at salary × employment duration
     * Tax revenue contributions
     * Reduced social service costs (welfare, language classes)
     * Well-being improvements (QALYs or well-being valuation studies)
   - Sensitivity: How does SROI change if we adjust key assumptions by ±20%?
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence for outcome-to-value conversions (e.g., job readiness → employment rate)

3. **Portfolio Performance: Outcome Dimensions** (2 paragraphs, 300-350 words):
   - Treat each outcome dimension as a "portfolio asset"
   - **Highest ROI**: Which dimension shows strongest improvement? (e.g., Job Readiness at {{formatPercent avgJobReadiness}})
   - **Strategic Bets**: Where are we investing effort? (e.g., language coaching, mentorship)
   - **Risk Areas**: Which dimensions underperform? What's the mitigation plan?
   - Use participant voices from evidence to illustrate value creation
   - CRITICAL: Minimum 2 citations per paragraph, linking outcomes to economic value

4. **Volunteer Capital Efficiency (VIS Deep Dive)** (1-2 paragraphs, 200-250 words):
   - Explain VIS ({{formatNumber visScore 1}}/100) as a measure of volunteer leverage
   - Calculate implied volunteer value: If VIS is high, volunteers are multiplying impact
   - Compare to benchmark: What's typical VIS for integration programs? (if data available)
   - Strategic implication: How do we scale volunteer engagement without diluting quality?
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence showing volunteer-participant interaction quality

5. **ESG Risk Mitigation & Upside** (1-2 paragraphs, 200-250 words):
   - **Risk Mitigation**:
     * Workforce diversity reduces talent acquisition risk
     * Community engagement reduces reputational risk
     * Regulatory compliance (CSRD, ESG disclosure mandates)
   - **Upside Opportunities**:
     * Access to multilingual, globally-connected talent
     * Innovation from diverse perspectives
     * Brand premium with ESG-conscious customers
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence linking program to business outcomes (if available) or participant outcomes as proxy

6. **Forward Guidance & Investment Case** (1 paragraph, 120-150 words):
   - Expected SROI trajectory for next period
   - Planned investments to improve outcome dimensions
   - Scaling strategy: can we maintain or improve SROI at 2x participant volume?
   - Alignment with investor ESG mandates (e.g., UN PRI, SFDR Article 9)
   - CRITICAL: Ground projections in evidence-based trends
