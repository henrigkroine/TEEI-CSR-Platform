**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1. **Abstract** (1 paragraph, 150-200 words):
   - Summarize the purpose of this whitepaper
   - State the two primary metrics: SROI and VIS
   - Mention data sources and lineage tracking
   - Highlight methodological rigor and validation
   - CRITICAL: Cite at least 1 evidence snippet showing data provenance

2. **Metric Definition: Social Return on Investment (SROI)** (3 paragraphs, 400-500 words):
   - **Formula**: SROI = (Social Value Created) / (Investment)
   - Define each component:
     * Investment: Program costs (staff, materials, volunteer time valuation)
     * Social Value: Sum of outcome improvements × stakeholder attribution × financial proxies
   - Explain the 5 outcome dimensions and their weightings
   - Detail the financial proxy methodology (e.g., well-being → healthcare cost savings, job readiness → employment earnings)
   - Reference SROI Network standards and CSRD alignment
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence showing how outcome scores feed into SROI calculation (minimum 2 citations)
   - TABLE REFERENCE: Include "[[TABLE: sroi-component-breakdown]]"

3. **Metric Definition: Volunteer Impact Score (VIS)** (3 paragraphs, 400-500 words):
   - **Formula**: VIS = (Volunteer Hours × Quality Factor × Outcome Attribution) / Benchmark
   - Define each component:
     * Volunteer Hours: Tracked via time logs and session attendance
     * Quality Factor: Volunteer consistency, beneficiary ratings, session completion
     * Outcome Attribution: % of outcome improvement attributable to volunteer interaction (vs. other factors)
     * Benchmark: Industry standard or internal baseline
   - Explain scaling to 0-100 range
   - Discuss limitations and confidence intervals
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence showing volunteer contributions and participant feedback (minimum 2 citations)
   - TABLE REFERENCE: Include "[[TABLE: vis-calculation-table]]"

4. **Data Sources & Lineage** (2 paragraphs, 300-350 words):
   - List primary data sources:
     * Kintell upskilling platform (learning progress, session logs)
     * Buddy matching service (social engagement, feedback)
     * Evidence snippets (Q2Q-derived qualitative insights)
     * Outcome scores table (aggregated dimension scores)
   - Explain OpenLineage instrumentation for full provenance tracking
   - Detail data pipeline: raw → staging → marts → metrics
   - Mention dbt semantic layer and metric governance
   - CRITICAL: Cite specific evidence IDs with their lineage chain (minimum 2 citations)
   - TABLE REFERENCE: Include "[[TABLE: data-lineage-map]]"

5. **Data Quality Framework** (2 paragraphs, 300-350 words):
   - Describe Great Expectations test suites for critical tables
   - Detail validation rules:
     * Schema validation (column types, NOT NULL constraints)
     * Range checks (scores 0-1, SROI >0, VIS 0-100)
     * Referential integrity (evidence → outcome_scores FK)
     * Freshness checks (<24h SLA)
     * Outlier detection (SROI >10, VIS >100 flagged for review)
   - Explain data quality score calculation ({{dataQualityScore}}/100)
   - Present current quality metrics with targets
   - CRITICAL: Reference data quality metadata provided above (minimum 1 citation)
   - TABLE REFERENCE: Include "[[TABLE: data-quality-metrics]]"

6. **Calculation Walkthrough: Worked Example** (2 paragraphs, 300-350 words):
   - Walk through SROI calculation for this period:
     * Investment: $X (staff) + $Y (materials) + $Z (volunteer time @ market rate)
     * Social Value: (Confidence Δ × proxy) + (Belonging Δ × proxy) + ... = Total
     * SROI = Total / Investment = {{formatNumber sroiRatio 2}}:1
   - Walk through VIS calculation:
     * Volunteer Hours: {{volunteersCount}} volunteers × avg hours
     * Quality Factor: {{visQualityFactor}} (based on ratings)
     * Outcome Attribution: {{visAttribution}}%
     * VIS = (Hours × Quality × Attribution) / Benchmark × 100 = {{formatNumber visScore 1}}
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence snippets used in attribution analysis (minimum 2 citations)
   - CHART REFERENCE: Include "[[CHART: sroi-calculation-flowchart]]"

7. **Validation & Auditing** (2 paragraphs, 250-300 words):
   - Describe validation processes:
     * Golden tests: dbt metrics vs. service calculators must match
     * Lineage validation: ≥90% of metrics have traceable lineage
     * Citation validation: ≥1 evidence per claim
     * PII redaction audit: post-redaction leak detection
   - Explain audit trail and immutability:
     * Report lineage table (model, prompt version, timestamp, tokens)
     * Citation metadata (snippet ID, relevance score)
     * Evidence hash for tamper detection
   - Mention compliance with GDPR (data residency) and CSRD (ESG reporting)
   - CRITICAL: Reference lineage coverage ({{lineageCoverage}}%) with evidence (minimum 1 citation)

8. **Limitations & Future Enhancements** (2 paragraphs, 200-250 words):
   - Acknowledge current limitations:
     * Financial proxies are estimates, not actual earnings
     * Attribution modeling has confidence intervals (±X%)
     * Evidence base may have sampling bias (most engaged participants provide feedback)
     * Outcome causality vs. correlation challenges
   - Propose future improvements:
     * Longitudinal tracking for causal inference
     * External benchmarking for VIS normalization
     * Enhanced lineage with data versioning
     * Real-time data quality dashboards
   - CRITICAL: Ground limitations in evidence (minimum 1 citation)

9. **Conclusion** (1 paragraph, 100-120 words):
   - Restate the rigor and transparency of the methodology
   - Emphasize lineage, data quality, and validation as differentiators
   - Invite feedback and external validation
   - CRITICAL: At least 1 citation
