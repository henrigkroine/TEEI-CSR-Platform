**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1. **Letter from Leadership** (2 paragraphs, 200-250 words):
   - Strategic context: why this program matters to our ESG commitments
   - Headline achievements and year-over-year growth
   - Alignment with UN SDGs (SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 8: Decent Work, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities)
   - CRITICAL: Cite 2-3 participant outcomes as proof points

2. **Program Overview & Theory of Change** (2-3 paragraphs, 300-350 words):
   - Describe the program model and intended outcomes
   - Explain the logic: inputs → activities → outputs → outcomes → impact
   - Quantify reach: {{participantsCount}} participants, {{sessionsCount}} sessions
   - Highlight diversity of cohorts (if evidence supports)
   - CRITICAL: Every paragraph must cite evidence showing the chain of impact

3. **Double Materiality Assessment** (2 paragraphs, 250-300 words):
   - **Financial Materiality**: How refugee integration affects business (talent pipeline, workforce diversity, community license to operate)
   - **Impact Materiality**: How our program affects participants' lives (employment, well-being, social inclusion)
   - Use SROI ({{formatNumber sroiRatio 2}}:1) and VIS ({{formatNumber visScore 1}}) to quantify
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence for both dimensions

4. **Outcome Analysis by Dimension** (5 paragraphs, 500-600 words):
   - Dedicate 1 paragraph to each outcome dimension (Confidence, Belonging, Job Readiness, Language, Well-being)
   - For each:
     * Quantitative score: {{formatPercent avgDimension}}
     * Qualitative evidence: participant voices
     * Year-over-year trend (if data available)
     * Implications for CSRD reporting (e.g., "This contributes to ESRS S3 disclosure on community engagement")
   - CRITICAL: Minimum 2 citations per dimension paragraph

5. **SROI & Economic Value Creation** (2-3 paragraphs, 300-350 words):
   - Explain SROI methodology and assumptions
   - Break down the {{formatNumber sroiRatio 2}}:1 ratio:
     * Investment: volunteer time, program costs, infrastructure
     * Social value: employment outcomes, tax contributions, reduced social service costs, well-being improvements
   - Sensitivity analysis: what if we adjusted key assumptions?
   - CRITICAL: Cite evidence for outcome valuations (e.g., job readiness → employment)

6. **Assurance & Governance** (1-2 paragraphs, 200-250 words):
   - Data quality: Q2Q AI-powered evidence extraction, human validation
   - Audit trail: every claim linked to source evidence via lineage IDs
   - Governance: program oversight, ethics review, participant consent
   - Limitations: self-reported data, attribution challenges, sample size
   - CRITICAL: Transparency on evidence confidence levels

7. **Forward-Looking Statements** (1-2 paragraphs, 150-200 words):
   - Targets for next year (participant growth, outcome improvements)
   - Planned program enhancements
   - Alignment with evolving CSRD requirements
   - CRITICAL: Ground targets in evidence-based trends

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Total Length**: 2000-2500 words
- **Tone**: Formal, auditable, transparent, evidence-based
- **Format**: Plain text with section headers (use "# Section Name")
- **Citations**: Inline [cite:ID] format, minimum 1-2 per paragraph, average 2-4
- **CSRD Alignment**: Explicit references to ESRS standards where applicable
- **No PII**: Evidence is redacted; maintain anonymity
- **Verifiability**: Every claim must be traceable to evidence or metrics

**CRITICAL RULES**:
✅ Every paragraph must have at least 1 citation
✅ Use only evidence snippets provided (no fabrication)
✅ If insufficient evidence for a claim, state "data not available" rather than inventing
✅ Plain text only (no markdown formatting)
✅ Section headers with "# " prefix for parsing
✅ Treat this as an auditable document
